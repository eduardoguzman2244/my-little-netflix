# 🎬 My Little Netflix

This project is a simple **movie database web application** developed as part of a course midterm assignment.  
It follows the **MVC (Model–View–Controller)** design pattern and uses **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** to manage a list of movies directly in the browser via **localStorage**.

Users can:
- 👀 **Show** movie details (title, director, image)
- ✏️ **Edit** existing movies
- ➕ **Add** new movies
- ❌ **Delete** movies with confirmation
- 🔄 **Reset** the database to its default state

All data is stored locally in the browser, allowing full CRUD functionality without a backend.
